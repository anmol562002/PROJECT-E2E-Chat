# PROJECT-E2E-Chat
This is End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a type of messaging that keeps messages private from everyone, including the messaging service. When E2EE is used, a message only appears in decrypted form for the person and the person receiving the message. The sender is one "end" of the conversation and the recipient is the other "end"; hence the name "end-to-end."
I use HTML , CSS and java script for making that app.
